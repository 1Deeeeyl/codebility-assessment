# Frontend Assessment (1–2 Years Experience)

## Overview

Welcome to the **1–2 Years** frontend assessment!  
Your main task is to **replicate a design** on the homepage of this Next.js app. We’ll provide a link to the mockup or design reference (currently a placeholder link in this README). You’ll work on a separate Git branch named after yourself, commit your changes, and open a Pull Request.

## Task Summary

1. **Use Next.js** (version 15 or the current stable release).
2. Implement the design on the main page (`src/page.tsx` or `src/page.tsx`).
3. Keep the look and layout **as close as possible** to the provided design reference.
4. Ensure **basic responsiveness** for desktop and mobile.
5. Limit the complexity to **1–2 days** of work.

## Steps to Complete

### 1. Create & Switch to a New Branch

1. Clone or pull the latest version of this repository.
2. From your local repo folder, run:

- git checkout -b firstname-lastname/1-2-Years-frontend

3. Confirm you’re on the new branch:

- git branch
  (You should see your new branch highlighted)

### 2. Implement the Design on index.tsx

1. Open `src/page.tsx` in your code editor.

2. Use your preferred styling approach (CSS modules, Tailwind, etc.) to replicate the design.

3. Reference the design mockup link `(placeholder below)` for layout, colors, typography, etc.
   Design Mockup (placeholder): Design Reference Here

4. You can create additional components under a components/ directory if needed.

### 3. Test Your Work

1. Install dependencies and run the development server:

- npm install
- npm run dev

2. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

3. Confirm the homepage matches (or closely follows) the design.

4. Resize your browser to ensure responsive behavior.

### 4. Commit & Push

1. Stage and commit your changes:

- git add .
- git commit -m "`[message here]`"

2. Push your branch to the remote repository:

- git push origin firstname-lastname/frontend

### 5. Open a Pull Request (PR)

1. Go to the repository’s page on GitHub (or your Git hosting platform).

2. You should see an option to “Compare & pull request” for your new branch, or click “New pull request.”

3. Select your branch as the source.

4. Give the PR a clear title (e.g., "Feature: [Your Name] - Frontend UI Implementation").

5. In the description, feel free to mention:

- How closely you followed the design.
- Any challenges or special considerations.

6. Submit the PR for review.

### Time Estimate

- This assignment should take 1–2 days.
- If you need more time, that’s fine—please note any incomplete aspects in your PR description.

### Tips

- Keep your solution as simple as possible (no advanced libraries unless necessary).
- Focus on clean code, basic responsiveness, and attention to layout details.
- Document any assumptions or limitations in your PR description.

### Good luck, and happy coding!
